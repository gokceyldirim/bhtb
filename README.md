🕰️🌌 Black Hole Time Bank🌌🕰️

A Blockchain Simulation of Time-Dilated Finance
(built with care and caffeine)

Summary

Black Hole Time Bank is a Python-powered blockchain project that reimagines finance through the lens of general relativity, simply a relativistic banking simulation. Built from scratch, this simulation features a banking system where transactions experience artificial time dilation — a nod to the physics behind black holes. Modern tech industry is mostly dominated by innovation at the intersection of disciplines, so I wanted to intersect some disciplines and have fun.

The project draws from my high school physics thesis on black hole time dilation and fuses it with foundational programming concepts I’ve been learning as a first-year computer engineering student. 
Inspired by the concept of time dilation near black holes, this project imagines a sci-fi-style bank where users deposit and withdraw "time credits" affected by gravitational fields. It’s a beginner-friendly project designed to explore the features stated below with simple descriptions:


| 🧮 Physics Engine| Calculates relativistic time gain using Schwarzschild metric |
| ⛓️ Mini Blockchain System| Secure, mined transactions with proof-of-work |
| 🧾 Transaction Logs| Deposits & withdrawals saved via persistent CSV handling |
| 🖼️ Graphical Interface| Tkinter-powered GUI for user interaction |
| 🛡️ Edge Case Protection| Error handling for invalid input, overdraw, or corrupted data |
| ⛏️ Mining Difficulty| Adjustable difficulty to simulate work-intensive block creation |
| ✅ Blockchain Validation| Re-verifies chain on each transaction for data integrity |


While this isn’t meant to be a real banking system, it’s a sandbox for learning how distributed systems and physics-inspired logic can interact.

🙏 Acknowledgements

This project was inspired by my high school graduation thesis on time dilation near black holes and I’d like to extend a special thanks to my high school seatmates Damla Bengü Mercangöz and Eda Sayar, who provided me moral support throughout the process of my thesis on time dilation.
